- Vincent van Gogh -

The Quote: "Instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I see before me, 
I make more arbitrary use of color to express myself more forcefully
... To express the love of two lovers by the marriage of two complementary colors
... To express the thought of a brow by the radiance of a light tone against a dark background. 

To express hope by some star. Someone's passion by the radiance of the setting sun


The Takeaway: 
Like many of the other visual artists, 
Vincent Van Gogh describes color as a vehicle for expressing relationship dynamics and contrasts, 
like harmony and discord, dark and light.
